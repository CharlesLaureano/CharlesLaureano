## Introduction

In the era of vast internet access and seamless communication, individuals often struggle to effectively engage with multiple people simultaneously. DND is a web application designed to address this challenge by providing a platform for social groups to integrate and coordinate their schedules with ease.

Unlike conventional video conference applications, DND offers users the unique ability to focus their time and attention on specific individuals or groups, promoting sustained concentration on relevant topics. By utilizing DND, users can prioritize their interactions and allocate dedicated time slots for meaningful conversations, ensuring efficient and focused communication.

One of the key features of DND is its interactive scheduling system. Users can easily select specific time slots and invite friends to engage in discussions, collaborative work, or social activities. This scheduling functionality fosters transparency and clarity, enabling social groups to synchronize their availability and plan their interactions effectively.

By streamlining scheduling processes and utilizing Gmail as the messaging platform, DND mitigates uncertainties and strengthens communication dynamics within social circles. Whether it's coordinating meetings, organizing study sessions, or planning social events, DND simplifies the coordination process, reducing conflicts, and enhancing overall productivity.
